# Go-CD Simple Email Task plugin

Now sending emails from Go is so simple. 

### Setup 
- Download the `go-cd-simple-email-task-plugin-1.0.jar` 
- Put it inside your $GO_SERVER/plugins/external
- Restart your Go Server


### Notes

This plugin uses the `mail` available on Linux / Mac to send emails, so no Windows for now. I am not aware of how to get the server settings from the plugin so that we can use existing configured settings to send email.
